Mainly because of how easy it is to order, and it wastes very little time. However, the main drawback of ordering anything online is the customer's perception of the product and the actual thing, which is why people are more reliant on reviews to see if it's worth buying. Reviews are also important in the business to determine if the product is good enough and what can be improved. This can also indirectly affect sales as products with more negative reviews would less likely get sold, same logic can also be said for positive reviews.\n\nThis analysis will revolve around the performance of the product, and how other factors such as age groups and product category affect the overall quality.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-22T08:18:48.032614Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-22T08:18:48.033165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-22T08:18:48.038063Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-22T08:18:48.033061Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-22T08:18:48.036692Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n#data visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches #create custom legends\nplt.style.use(\"ggplot\")\n\n#text pre-processing\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.tokenize import WhitespaceTokenizer, word_tokenize #tokenization of words\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \nstop = stopwords.words(\"english\")\n\n#text visualization\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS #wordcloud generator for reviews\nfrom nltk import pos_tag #Part of Speech tagging which will be used alongside the wordcloud\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \n        \nnp.random.seed(92384) #for repeatability\n        \ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../input/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews/Womens Clothing E-Commerce Reviews.csv\", index_col = 0 )","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T03:44:55.254529Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-23T03:44:55.255122Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.004699Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-23T03:44:55.254996Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.003618Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.006772Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.007079Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.017217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.007048Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.015831Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.019098Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.019405Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.046106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.019377Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-23T03:44:56.044923Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Does the data make any sense?\n\nBefore any analysis will be done, let's check the quality of the data.

We have learned that age doesn't necessarily affect the review ratings, breaking down the Net Promoter Score by its division group doesn't show any difference, the most outspoken group came from the baby boomers, and we've identified the best and worst performing Clothing Id's. Going further into that, we saw that the very same reasons for why people hate the product on the worst reviewed section are the same things why people love the product on the best items section. This leads me to believe that the reason for the bad products came from the source of the raw materials as well as the assmebly plant of the clothes. Those should be determined and be changed or altogether take out the specific clothing ID's as negative reviews can directly affect the sales of the product.\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}
