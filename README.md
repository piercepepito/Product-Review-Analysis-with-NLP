# Product-Review-Analysis-with-NLP

E-commerce has grown a lot and people have gone more and more reliant on it over brick and mortar stores. Mainly because of how easy it is to order, and it wastes very little time. However, the main drawback of ordering anything online is the customer's perception of the product and the actual thing, which is why people are more reliant on reviews to see if it's worth buying. Reviews are also important in the business to determine if the product is good enough and what can be improved. This can also indirectly affect sales as products with more negative reviews would less likely get sold, same logic can also be said for positive reviews.

This analysis will revolve around the performance of the product, and how other factors such as age groups and product category affect the overall quality.

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nicapotato/womens-ecommerce-clothing-reviews). I initially added my notes in Kaggle, under the letmebe username.
